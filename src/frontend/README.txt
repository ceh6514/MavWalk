It can only go from the Central Library to the Mavericks Activity Center. The MAC coords seems to be a bit off, but Central Library coords seem to be fine.
Will need to adjust the coords and provide more routes if possible.
Also, the route's directions are super incorrect, so need to fix that up to.
The UI text seems to be a little messed up too.
